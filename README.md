To address the KrispCall Revenue Attribution Analysis task in Google Colab, I’ll provide a complete Python script that meets all requirements: implementing First-Touch, Usage-Based, and Linear Attribution models, performing data validation, generating visualizations, and producing a detailed analysis summary. The script will handle the provided datasets (final_workspace_data.csv, final_payment_refund_data.csv, final_integration_data.csv, final_calls_sms_detailed_data.csv) and address the team_size error from the previous run by using total_users. The output will include three CSV files, a Python script, an analysis summary, and visualizations, all saved in the ./output/ directory.
Key Considerations

Datasets: The provided datasets match the structure in the data dictionary, with 50 workspaces, 105 payment/refund records, 119 integration events, and 1572 call/SMS events.
Attribution Models:

First-Touch: Assigns 100% of net revenue to the first integration connected after the first payment.
Usage-Based: Distributes revenue based on communication volume (call duration + normalized SMS segments).
Linear (Chosen): Equally distributes revenue across all active integrations.


Visualizations: Includes a correlation heatmap, histograms, a count plot with clear labels, and a Chart.js bar chart for model comparison.
Data Validation: Checks user existence, temporal constraints, and platform availability.
Output: Generates first_touch_attribution.csv, usage_based_attribution.csv, chosen_attribution.csv, analysis_summary.md, and plots.

Solution Approach

Setup: Ensure dependencies and output directory in Colab.
Data Loading: Read all CSV files, handling missing values and data types.
EDA: Display dataset info, summary statistics, missing values, and generate visualizations.
Validation: Verify users, temporal constraints, and platform usage.
Net Revenue: Calculate payments minus refunds per owner.
Attribution Models: Implement First-Touch, Usage-Based, and Linear models.
Visualizations: Generate plots and a Chart.js configuration.
Summary: Write a 500-1000 word analysis with methodology, findings, and recommendations.

Explanation of Flow Sections

Load All Datasets

final_workspace_data.csv

final_payment_refund_data.csv

final_integration_data.csv

final_calls_sms_detailed_data.csv

Data Validation & Cleaning

Ensure users match across datasets

Remove/flag invalid timestamps outside allowed payment→refund windows

Ensure platform usage follows integration connection rules

Net Revenue Calculation

Only workspace owners generate revenue

Net Revenue = Total Payments – Total Refunds

Drop or flag customers with zero/negative revenue

Platform Usage Aggregation

Calls → seconds of duration

SMS → number of segments

Normalize SMS and call data to a common usage unit for fairness

Attribution Models

First-Touch: 100% revenue → first integration connected post-payment

Usage-Based: Revenue split proportionally based on usage volume

Custom Model: You define and justify methodology
